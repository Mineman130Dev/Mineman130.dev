        <h2 class="textBoxDEVLOG"><u>September 29th, 2025 - New look for the website</u></h2><br>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;">It's been about 2 months since my first devlog and I haven't coded in a while, I started this update back in August but never got it done until now. I've been quite busy with my private life and don't believe there will be any new updates to JoltNotes for now.</p>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;">There is still hope though, I would like to get back into coding yet I don't find JoltNotes interesting anymore but I would hate to leave it in a broken/half finished state. Having that said, before I stop updating JoltNotes I would like to finish the sevreal notes saving functions and work any bugs out.</p>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;">I do not know what I would like to work on after JoltNotes is finshed but it'll be a bit before I truley know what that is.</p>

        <h2 class="textBoxDEVLOG"><u>July 30th, 2025 - What's in store for JoltNotes</u></h2><br>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;">Welcome to my first devlog for JotNotes, I thought I could start something like this to one, shorten my release nots for updates on JoltNotes, but to also express my options somewhere. I just released v0.2.1 of JoltNotes, removing the most important function for a notes app...</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>The menu button</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;">I removed this due to the fact that I did not understand how to add this function. All that button did was bring a new menu up that said settings and notes. I had no clue how to add notes to that menu, or even add notes to the users computer storage to store sevreal notes. But I will bring that back, however it might not be very soon.</p>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;">This update is the first offical release of a stable build, not a alpha or beta. So I don't plan to release another for a bit, I'm a bit slow on releasing any updates. I will be starting development on v0.3.0-alpha.0 starting tomorrow, mainly brainstorming ideas of what I could add or remove. In the meantime I will be updating the stable build of 0.2.1, fixing anything thats broken and refining the version, making it perfect.</p>
        <p class="textBoxDEVLOG" style="font-size: 20px;">This is it for me for now, but I do plan to write soon. This will be a devlog for everything I work on, the title will show what I'm talking about.</p>
